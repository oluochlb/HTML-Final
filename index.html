<h1>How Do Basketball Shoes Help Improve Players Performance?</h1>


<h3> A good pair of basketball shoes will help players advance their skill set and decrease the chance for injury. The demand for high-quality basketball shoes is immense, which is why most performance sneakers are expensive and
  available in limited supply. An average pair of performance basketball shoes will range from $100 to $150. Some high-end sneakers, like the Harden vol.1, cost a few hundred dollars. The best basketball shoes ultimately supply
  players with added ankle support, durability and traction. There are three distinct types of basketball shoes: high-tops, mid-tops and low-tops. Each type of shoe showcases distinct advantages. High-tops provide the best ankle
  support, but are the heaviest type of basketball shoe. This can decrease speed-burst ability needed for fast-break situations. Mid-top sneakers stop at ankle level, enabling players to leverage added movement, but this type of
  shoe provides less stability than high-tops. Low-tops provide the least amount of ankle support, but are the lightest type of sneaker. Low-top basketball shoes will allow players to best take advantage of speed and quickness.
